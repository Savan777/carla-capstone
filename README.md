# CARLA Capstone Project

### Introduction
CARLA is a driving simulator that is broken up into two parts. There is the CARLA server-side simulator and the CARLA Python API for client-side. This project is based off of CARLA 0.9.5 for Windows *(Experimental)*. Most of our modifications are in the Python API where we have modified the code so that it is more integrated with hardware components.
